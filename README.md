# E-commerce-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-Project
This project delves into the analysis and visualization of e-commerce data from a Brazilian company, Olist. The data spans various aspects of the e-commerce ecosystem, including customer behavior, product categories, sales, marketing funnel, and more. The aim is to extract meaningful insights to aid business decision-making processes.

Key Outcomes:

Data Preparation and Normalization: The dataset underwent thorough cleaning and normalization processes to address missing, empty, or duplicate values. This step ensures the integrity and quality of the data for subsequent analysis.
SQL DDL: The SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) was utilized to create a new database and set up tables in the highest normal form. This ensures efficient storage and retrieval of data while maintaining data integrity through proper constraints and keys.
SQL Queries and Visualization: Complex SQL queries were designed to extract specific insights from the dataset. These queries ranged from summarizing sales data in different categories to analyzing payment trends over time. Additionally, the results were visualized using ggplot, providing intuitive representations of the findings.

Skills Exhibited:

Data cleaning and normalization techniques.
Proficiency in SQL query design and optimization.
Data visualization using ggplot in R.
Understanding of database design principles and normalization.
Interpretation and communication of analytical findings.

Technologies: SQL, R, ggplot.
